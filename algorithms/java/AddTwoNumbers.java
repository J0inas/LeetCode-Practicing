/* NOTES:
 * I must admit, I did not understand this task at first.
 * I had several thoughts starting out and then I had an algorithm that wasn't bad, 
 * but returned an integer instead of a list.
 * That was the point I decided to look at an explanation and found this: 
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/solutions/1835535/java-c-a-very-beautiful-explanation-ever-exists/
 * That 3 stepped helped a lot and proved my initial thought starting out:
 * "you could add the list node for node -> sum of the list", but what about them 10's?
 * That's what I want to solve now.
